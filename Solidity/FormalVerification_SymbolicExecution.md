# Formal Verification

Act of proving or disproving a given property of a system using a mathematical model


# Symbolic Execution

Symbolic execution is a technique where you try to explore the different paths of the program and represent those paths as mathematical expressions to try to prove something. For every execution path, youâ€™re going to create a mathematical representation. 

# Fuzz

Fuzzing is where you take random inputs and run them through your program. So you have to define things in your code that you always want to hold true.
