- GraphQL is a Query Language
- Alternative to REST API

# Drawbacks of RESTAPI
    - Overfetching - getting back more data than we need
    - Underfetching -  getting back less data than we need

- Single Endpoint in Grapghql instead of multiple endpoints like in RESTAPI
- Ex. https://mygraphqlsite.com/graphql
