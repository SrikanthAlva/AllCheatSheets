# Who is a Market Marker?

A market maker is a person or entity that provides liquidity to a market by buying and selling assets at a specified price. Market makers `help to reduce the spread between bid and ask prices`, and facilitate transactions for other traders. 

## Tasks of a Market Maker

- **Quoting prices**: Market makers quote both buy and sell prices for an asset, and are willing to execute trades at those prices. They profit from the difference between the bid and ask prices, also known as the spread.
- **Providing inventory**: Market makers hold a certain amount of inventory of the asset they are trading, and adjust their holdings according to the market conditions. They may also hedge their positions to reduce their risk exposure.
- **Managing risk**: Market makers face various risks, such as price fluctuations, liquidity shocks, and counterparty default. They use various strategies and tools to manage their risk, such as diversifying their portfolio, setting limits, and using algorithms.
- **Supporting market stability**: Market makers contribute to the efficiency and stability of the market by providing liquidity and reducing volatility. They also help to prevent market manipulation and arbitrage opportunities by maintaining fair prices.
